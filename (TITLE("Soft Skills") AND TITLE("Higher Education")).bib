abstract={This chapter focuses on the new conceptualization of linguistic mediation as presented in the Common European Framework of Reference (CFER) Companion Volume and its role in the development of soft skills as the foundation for intercultural and interlinguistic communication. By the time of graduation, the 21st century student must have acquired a set of skills that were not required in the past, and educators have the responsibility to integrate these skills into their instructional practices. Therefore, these concepts are key elements in today's society characterized by globalization and connection with stakeholders in different environments. © 2021, IGI Global.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 is characterized by the digitalization of systems and processes in service and manufacturing industries and has changed the way people live. Education plays a significant role in preparing the future workforce with the necessary technological skills and competencies required by industries and institutions. Studies have shown that soft skills improve a student’s ability to learn, increase their potential for success, and typically increase future economic benefits. This study aims to determine the dominant soft skills that University students in Manado should possess. The perceptions of twentyfour lecturers about four criteria and twelve sub-criteria were compared using both the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) methods. From this, the researchers found teamwork to be the dominant skill (26%). Global analysis uncovered that integrity was the dominant factor overall (10.5% with AHP or 10.3% with F-AHP). The findings were provided to University leaders with recommendations to incorporate the elements of teamwork and integrity into their teaching materials, teaching methods, and curriculum. Students need to understand that these elements are essential to their future. This research proved that both the AHP and Fuzzy-AHP methods were effective tools in analyzing and determining the dominant factors of soft skills in the Industry 4.0 era. This research contributes to determining the priority factors related to soft skills needed by higher education graduates in the Industry 4.0 era using a combination of AHP and Fuzzy-AHP. The researchers recommended that other scholars conduct future studies using entrepreneurs or business practitioners as respondents. © 2022},

abstract={The growing digitalization that is taking place in most current societies, shaping a super-smart society - such as, for example, the aimed Society 5.0 - raises profound implications in the learning that the higher education context should foster, and which is summarized in the following question: what kind of skills should be taught and how? This perspective paper aims to analyze the centrality of soft skills in this new and unavoidable context, as well as the implications in the learning process. The results of a bibliographical search point toward the fact that, in addition to professional and scientific skills, soft skills are critical for professional and personal success, which implies a profound reformulation of the teaching processes in the overwhelming majority of higher education institutions and their actors. For this challenge to become a reality and for the success of these processes, elements such as digital literacy, sustainability and interculturality are paramount. © Copyright for this article is retained by the author(s)},

abstract={This study explores the impediments and the pressures to establish the policy of introducing skills and competencies in the Greek Higher Education (HE) accounting studies. Soft skills may improve considerably accountants’ career prospects whether they work in industry or auditing. A mixed-method approach with two data collection phases was undertaken; survey research and semi-structured interviews. Survey research addressed a questionnaire to accounting teachers, Business Administration and Accounting (BAA) students and accounting professionals, while interviews explored the deeper views of stakeholders. 1626 responses were collected and statistically analyzed. Participants agreed that the lack of Higher Education Institutions’ (HEIs) effective partnerships with external organizations are the highest barrier to skills development, while the apparent pressure comes from the obligation to comply with European Union (EU) recommendations and Bologna Agreement. Interviews revealed challenges related to the views about ‘marketization’ of HE and the superficial compliance with policies enforced by supranational organizations. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The objective of this research study is to determine the prevalence of soft skills in students at the Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios - UNIMINUTO (Colombia), in the academic programs of psychology and occupational health administration at the Bogotá-South and Zipaquirá campuses. The approach of the study is quantitative, descriptive in scope, and cross-sectional. The sample consists of 50 students in their last semesters. The results show that the most prevalent soft skills are listening, influence, and teamwork. The soft skills that require strengthening are responsibility and support. It is concluded that the labor market observes and demands the presence of soft skills in professionals, opening an opportunity for academics to strengthen behaviors associated with each soft skill by adapting academic curricula. © 2021.

abstract={Introduction. Modern professional activity of a specialist in tourism and hospitality requires the possession of not only highly specialized, so-called hard skills, but also skills, which in contrast to the former are considered “soft”. The growing tourism services sector, international competition, new forms of work organization require from a specialist to possess, first of all, the skills of self-organization, communication, teamwork, etc. Materials and methods. The study involved 86 people (46 people were in the control group; 40 people were in the experimental group) who were students of “Hospitality Management” at Tula State University. Methods of questionnaires, participant observation and “mystery shopping” were used to determine the level of formation of soft skills in the participants of the control group. The survey among employers (n=10) was conducted. To analyze the effectiveness of the forming experiment the χ2-Pearson’s criterion was used. Results. The formative stage of experimental work was associated with the introduction of organizational and pedagogical conditions in the practice of training bachelors in the direction of “Hotel Management”. It was found that the identified organizational and pedagogical conditions affect the formation of professionally significant qualities of a specialist, underlying its productive competitiveness in the field of professional activity. It was revealed that the students of the experimental group more actively form the skills of mental self-regulation and overcoming stressful situations (χ2 = 6.64; p&lt;0.05). Discussion. The practical significance of the results is determined by the possibility of their use in training not only specialists in the field of tourism, but also other representatives of professions that are part of the “human-human” system. © 2021 LLC Ecological Help.

abstract={The growing attention of the labour market to soft skills has led universities, in different countries to develop tools for the promotion and the assessment of generic skills. The studies carried out at the University of Turin on the design, implementation and testing of the Passport platform fall into this area. Passport is an articulated online course focusing on 12 soft skills. The course includes: a self-assessment Scale, 87 online activities (video clips, reflections, case studies…) and a final certification of the acquired skills. The effectiveness of the Passport course in favouring the academic success of fist-year students in terms of credits acquired, is attested by a previous follow-up research. The present study, on the other hand, aims to evaluate the contribution of the Passport training in improving students’ soft skill profile. © 2021},

abstract={Introduction. At present, employers’ standards for university graduates are scrutinized, obviously stepping up requirements for soft skills. The issue of modernization of university curricula or development of new ones that include soft skills development in the framework of university education is relevant. The importance of the problem makes us turn to the experiences of foreign universities. This article aims to identify the main subject areas, where much attention is paid to the issues of soft skills, as well as directions of research on students’ soft skills development between 2010 and 2020 in the framework of higher education. Materials and Methods. The study was conducted in two phases. During the first phase, we used a search strategy to identify the main subject areas of research on the topic of soft skills development in the period from 2010 to 2020. At the second phase, a study of one hundred most cited articles indexed in the Scopus database on the topic of soft skills in education was carried out. The selection was based on the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria. We used a method of content analysis. The selected articles were divided into several clusters demonstrating the research focus. Results. The analysis of foreign studies provided information on the subject fields that essentially focus on forming soft skills. The main subject areas, where the largest number of studies on soft skills published from 2010 to 2020 were recorded, embrace social sciences, IT, engineering, business and accounting. The areas of research on students’ soft skills in the period between 2010 and 2020 were general pedagogical issues, issues of increasing employability, and different areas of education. Discussion and Conclusion. A selection of the world's best practices described in the leading articles on the formation of soft skills in education enriches the collection of methodological techniques of teachers in various specialized disciplines. The materials of the article can be useful for methodologists and teachers of professional education institutions, engaged in the formation and development of a new type of curricula, taking into account the needs of the modern labor market, and persons interested in the problems of higher education. © 2021 National Research Ogarev Mordovia State University.

abstract={In addition to subject-specific (or technical) skills, so-called soft skills or 21st Century Skills, should be essential learning outcomes in almost any higher education curriculum. However, only a limited number of learning activities aiming at the development of soft skills are carried out in current higher education curricula. Multiplayer online games are considered as learning tools fostering soft skills. In this study, an elective course designed for teaching soft skills in engineering disciplines using the commercial multiplayer online game EVE Online is evaluated. Presented are the design of the online course, and evaluation results. Evaluation instruments include a questionnaire on social presence, intrinsic motivation, and expectations of students as well as semi-structured interviews. Overall, the evaluation renders multiplayer online games to be promising soft skills learning tools aiming at digital game-savvy students. Further, the evaluation provides guidance for enhancing the course design and thereby contributes to establishing multiplayer online games as learning tools for soft skills. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The focus of this research is on the problem of paradoxical and ambiguous development of soft skills in the context of modern education. In present-day scientific discourse, soft skills are addressed from two perspectives representing the competency-based approach relying on the theory of human capital and the humanistic approach rooted in the concept of Bildung. The performed analysis suggests that the main difference between these positions can be found in their educational goals: to develop the student’s soft skills for the sake of treating the student either as a means or as an end (by Kant’s ethics). Modern educational theory and practice are characterized by the first approach: Universities are aimed at satisfying the needs of the labor market (in keeping with the knowledge-driven economy pressing for development of soft skills). The comparative analysis of the revealed viewpoints demonstrates limitations of the competency-based approach and suggests the impor-tance of its humanization. The latter can be achieved, among other things, through refocusing from the human capital theory to the human capability approach. © 2021, University of Cienfuegos, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.

abstract={Purpose: The study aims to examine the influence of soft skill integration on the interpersonal soft skill levels of diploma business students in the private higher education institutions based in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia. Research Methods: The study was guided by the Soft Skill Development Model (2006) and the Soft Skill Integration method, according to Devadason, Subramaniam and Daniel (2010). This paper applied a descriptive quantitative survey method to assess the levels and relationships between the variables. A set of self-administered questionnaires were adapted based on Devadason, Subramaniam and Daniel’s (2010) instruments. The questionnaires were distributed through a proportionate stratified ranom sampling method to 429 respondents from 12 private higher learning institutions in three northern states of Peninsular Malaysia. Descriptive analysis, correlation, and regression analyses were applied in the findings. Findings: The results revealed a significant influence of the overall soft skill integration towards communication and teamwork levels. The study also advocated the significant impact of soft skill integration in problem-solving and critical thinking on all of the four essential soft skills elements. Implications for Research and Practice: Despite decades of emphasis on soft skill development, soft skill integration in Malaysia is still not at an optimal level. Embedding soft skills would lead to more real-life experiences, and they will horn students' skills, especially their problem-solving ability. The empirical evidence of soft skill integration contributes towards innovative teaching and learning experiences, social innovation, and the impact on school policies to develop what is required in the industry. © 2021 Ani Publishing Ltd.

abstract={Nowadays, as a result of economic changes, employers are eager to look for employees with applied skills rather than cognitive skills. Diplomas are not being considered as a definitive indicator of students’ professional intelligence as it used to be before. Fourth Industry Revolution has dramatically changed labor market and knowledge is now acknowledged as strength of productivity and economic growth, and information technology has acquired great importance. In such a situation, whether employees start their career or change a job, they can show successful performance, if they can change and update themselves continuously, build positive interpersonal relationships in the workplace, learn and win in the unpredictable challenges of the work place. Accordingly, today the graduates of Higher Education need to master not only professional skills of their job, but also various soft skills, including the ability to communicate, coordinate, work under pressure, and solve problems. The purpose of this article is to provide literature on the connection of soft skills with employability and world labour market, the role of soft skills in career success for future professionals. The article also examines the definition and selection of the most demanding soft skills from the perspective of different literature. The role of Higher Education in forming and developing soft skills will then be discussed. The article illustrates the results of survey carried out with the aim to analyze the degree of integration of soft skills in Study Skills program that is taught for bachelor students in Uzbek State World Languages University and academic curricula.

abstract={Since the beginning of the 21st century, organisations have been going through rapid changes. These affect not only companies but also socioeconomics, politics, information technology and managerial innovations: Developments in information systems are forcing companies to update their management systems and societal challenges (e.g. pandemias) are paradigm-shifting also in terms of how people work. Regardless, people consensually keep a critical role on the organizational knowledge management axis that is crucial for companies' competitive advantage (Monavvarian & Khamda, 2010). In the last decade, graduates' employability has been a matter of increasing concern and discussion amongst scholars. One of the most discussed topics is the quality of students and their lack of soft skills required to increase individual employability (Sin & Neave, 2016; Clarke, 2017). Higher Education Institutions (HEI) play a crucial role and have a social responsibility regarding the preparation of graduates with the skills and abilities required to be considered by the labour market (Sin & Neave, 2016), however, employers emphasize that graduates are not able to transfer the acquired skills to real-life situations (Shuayto, 2013) arguing that HEIs are still teaching academically oriented pedagogy instead of applied learning and functional skills (Sin & Neave, 2016). On top of this, the challenges the near future proposes are of an unknown and uncertain nature, and reports suggest they may derive from potentially cataclysmic events such as extreme climate events, terrorism and pandemics. These are situations that are completely novel and may require a set of skills that is yet to be developed and integrated in a working framework. In this paper we propose a conceptualization of the new soft skill set that HEIs should be implementing to enable students not only a higher employment rate but also the ability to deal and cope with unexpected and dramatic events with unforeseen consequences. © 2020 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

abstract={The aim of this study is to present a board game design which are based on the hotel management concepts, and assess its effectiveness towards soft skills development for higher education. Soft skills play a major role during social interaction in the society as well as maintaining a successful career. 5-ST☆R: The Hotel Management Game was proposed as a platform to develop soft skills among students in higher learning as to implement game-based learning and simulation-based learning for post-learning activity. A quasi-experimental research design was used as to measure the effectiveness of the board game in the development of soft skills. A sample of 64 students were being selected and assigned into two groups, one of which used the board game (Experimental, n = 32), while the other are the non-gaming (Control, n = 32). A questionnaire was used in the pre-test and post-test phase. During the intervention session, students were being observed and their scores and objectives achieved for each game session were recorded. Data analysis from the study support that the use of board game was effective in the development of the respondents’ soft skills. The results from the study recommend that within the higher learning environment, the use of board game can be exploited as an effective post-learning activity as the students also may be able to discover the knowledge on its own in a non-threatening environment. © 2020, Ankara University.

abstract={The Tito Rossini initiative is a project promoted by the Centre for Museum Studies based at Dept. of Education-University Roma Tre (Italy), where, starting from the promotion of Tito Rossini’s paintings collected and exhibited at the University premises, a specific fruition programme has been designed by the master students attending the module “Experimentalism, Museum and Reading”. The main aims of the designed museum educational programme were: to create interactive tools for the fruition of Rossini’s works of art; to increase visitors’ knowledge about Rossini and his collection exhibited at the University, to promote visitors 4C skills (communication, creativity, collaboration and critical thinking). In order to create an engaging user’s experience, different tools for cultural mediation were realized for each Rossini’s painting under investigation: a description, a brief audio narrative (linked to a QR code) inspired by the artwork (text also in Braille Code) and a music soundtrack played by the students themselves participating in the project. Specific assessment tools were designed and used in the museum educational programme. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

A mixed method was employed utilizing a questionnaire and interview protocol as research instruments. In total, eight lecturers and 163 students from four programs of an international college in Khon Kaen, Thailand were selected using a purposive sampling method. The quantitative findings indicated that teamwork and lifelong learning skills were the most important soft skills acquired by lecturers from all of four programs, except for tourism management. In addition, the qualitative findings revealed the importance aspects of soft skills acquisition are: (i) delivery of effective and quality teaching; (ii) career development and enrichment, and (iii) managing student skills. In summary, the findings contribute to and substitute for training and provide significant pronouncements towards the knowledgeable and dexterous development of the country as a total. © 2018 Kasetsart University.

abstract={There seems to be a gap between what industry expect from employees on the one hand, and the soft skills of recent graduates from Higher Education Institutions on the other. The aim of this paper was to investigate if the perceptions of IT-students regarding their own soft skills have changed over a period of 3 years. To do this a questionnaire was distributed in 2019 to the same students who completed this questionnaire in 2016, and the results were analysed. The results of this study showed that although soft skills should increase from student's first year of study to their final year, this is not how the students perceive the development of their own soft skills. The biggest improvements were in the students' perceptions of their skills in cross-cultural relationships, work ethic, decision-making and critical thinking. The skills for client management, time management, professionalism and leadership were perceived as lower. The results confirmed that the IT-students' own perceptions are not a reliable way of measuring their soft skills. Factor analysis was used to reduce the number of factors for further study, and according to this results the important soft skills were: Communication; Conflict management; Critical thinking; Interpersonal relations and teamwork; Leadership and Emotional intelligence; Multidisciplinary thinking; Professionalism and work ethic; and Self-management. These can now be used in further research on soft skills. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. ACM ISBN 978-1-4503-7225-1/19/11…$15.00},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of soft skill integration in the curriculum on quality of college life of diploma business students in Malaysian private higher educational institutions. Design/methodology/approach: Descriptive quantitative survey research was used to assess the views and relationship between variables from 429 business students in Peninsular Malaysia. The adapted self-administered questionnaires were distributed through stratified random sampling method. Descriptive analysis, correlation and regression analysis were used in the findings. Findings: The results advocated significant influence from soft skill integration on quality of college life. Soft skill integration in critical thinking and problem solving especially has significant positive influence on quality of college life in all the aspects from academic, social and also facilities. Research limitations/implications: Generalizability of the research as it was conducted in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia only. It was also limited by subjectivity bias of the students who responded to the questionnaire. Practical implications: The implication of this study was that it serves as an evidence-based information of soft skill integration and effects on college quality. In this way, it provides an empirical reference to the authorities for better guidelines, evaluation, control and development in the curriculum, delivery approaches, co-curriculum, campus environment or facilities. Social implications: Local education in particular is closely linked to the neighboring community and also dependent on the socio-economic needs of the state or region. According to Kayrooz and Parker (2010), greater engagement with local issues and higher local autonomy for spending could lead to greater effectiveness and efficiencies. Originality/value: The study was a pioneering research in the context of Malaysian private higher education, guided by Devadason et al.’s (2010) soft skill integration study in Malaysian public higher education, plus Sirgy et al.’s (2007) study on quality of college life. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The purpose of the study was to investigate how undergraduate and graduate business management students, as well as those who had a managerial role in their career and who did not, differ on levels of soft skills (SRL strategies, motivation, and social skills) after gender was controlled. Moreover, we intended to investigate how well soft skills factors influence business students’ successes in an online learning environment after students’ individual characteristics and learning characteristics were controlled. To serve this purpose, this study conducted MANCOVA and hierarchical multiple regression analyses on data collected from 162 students in fully online business courses. First, the results of the study indicated that graduate students had higher level of soft skills than undergraduate students, especially in self-regulation and motivation. Likewise, students with managerial experiences demonstrated a higher level of soft skills. Next, hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the final regression model with all soft skills factors included could predict approximately 34% of the variance in students learning outcomes to a statistically significant level. In addition, goal setting, self-efficacy, and social skills were found to be significant predictors. We suggest that instructors and instructional designers should realize that soft skills are important contributor to the learning outcomes. Therefore, mechanisms to enhance student soft skills should be embedded into the online course in order to improve student learning outcomes. This should be especially a priority for undergraduate online courses because undergraduate students do not demonstrate higher soft skills compared to graduate students. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Soft skills, though prized by software companies when hiring new professional, are not usually included as an active teaching topic in university careers in software engineering, information systems or computer science. In this article we report the main results of a survey on the state of soft skills teaching in software engineering in higher education institutions in Latin America. We found several university programs that include specific courses on soft skills. The respondents consider that combining soft skills in technical courses is a valid didactical approach, in addition to specific courses on soft skills. While the results cannot be generalized by virtue of the size of the sample, respondents have a favorable opinion regarding that the teaching of these skills should be included in the curricula of those careers, and there is also a high interest in creating a community of professors and researchers to work together in researching and dissemination of initiatives in teaching soft skills in software engineering. © XXII Ibero-American Conference on Software Engineering, CIbSE 2019.

abstract={Soft skills are defined as socio-emotional abilities, important for personal development, social participation, academic and work achievement, and are ideally opposite to specific technical skills. University is today called to adapt to the demands of a complex and mutable labour market, where it is important to support the graduates’ employability and to prepare future professionals who possess, in addition to technical skills, also soft skills. The University of Turin has introduced a theoretical and methodological reflection about soft skills’assessment and development in its students, through the Passport.Unito Project. According to international literature, a model of 12 soft skills was set up (Ben-nett et al., 1999; Heckman & Kautz, 2016): area of task (problem solving and decision making, time and space management, adoption of strategies adequate in tackling the task); area of the self (self-enhancement, emotional self-regulation, enterprise); motivational area (goal orientation, causal attribution, resilience); area of the interpersonal relationships (teamwork, communication, conflict management). The Project considers the development of a soft skills self-assessment tool (PassporTest), aimed at providing a description of the level of the different soft skills in the model. In this study are presented the validation data (exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, reliability, validity) and the results of a first survey on a large sample of students from different University degree programs (N = 1048). © 2018, Edizioni Universitarie di Lettere Economia Diritto.

abstract={Despite the ubiquity of staff soft skills programmes, few studies have examined why and how academic and corporate services staff utilise these programmes for self-care/governance. This study reports on findings from an ethnography of soft skills learning and development programmes (LDPs) in a UK university, focusing on interviews with programme participants and facilitators. Results suggest that, as social worlds with neoliberal directives, LDPs promote various self-governance activities in the form of entrepreneurism and novel, corporate versions of self-care. Time on LDPs was seen as a chance to, ‘put oneself first,’ examine career options and cultivate sought-after attributes, including self-confidence and assertiveness. Social networking and performance management also emerged as significant issues. Career development was important for all participants; however, perceptions of how to realise this differed. Based on our findings, we propose three types of work-related performance–‘career nomad,’ ‘reluctant entrepreneur,’ and ‘course hopper’–constituting a typology for understanding social worlds inhabited by contemporary university professionals. Our study suggests that self-care ‘technologies’ have multiple, competing functions in continuing professional education. While LDPs can help professionals navigate paths through increasingly challenging organisations, their entrepreneurial ethos and content reflect the market interests they serve. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Several reports by the European Union have also sought to introduce methodologies aimed at integrating soft skills within the learning and teaching processes. In the same vein, O’Dowd and Lewis (Online intercultural exchange: policy, pedagogy, practice. Routledge, London, 2016) note the potential of online intercultural exchanges in the development of students’ foreign language and intercultural communication skills. This study describes a telecollaboration experience between two classes of university students: English students learning Spanish, and Spanish students learning English. A total of 32 participants exchanged and shared views on six topics over a three-month period by using online tools ICT. It then explores the results of the self-assessment process through which students evaluate the cross-cultural and telecollaboration skills gained during this experience of using a foreign language to communicate. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={The environment of the 21st century adult and tertiary education has changed at several places. The obstacles of information flow have disappeared and the educational environment has been virtualized. At the same time, the learning habits of students have also changed radically. These changes should be followed by teriary and adult education as well. By accepting these phenomena workers of tertiary and adult education have to face a lot of fresh challenges. It is very important for them to adjust to the trends mentioned above. Even those people who are not certified teachers need information, pedagogical and psychological knowledge to be able to find their way in the pedagogy of adult and tertiary education. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={It is generally agreed that hard skills, such as practical skills and theoretical knowledge, are extremely important for the execution of professional tasks. However, soft skills make a difference between the simple "job well done" and the ability to obtain superior performance in teams and the integration in each organization and society in general. In recent years higher education institutions throughout the world have started offering training programs for developing soft skills. However, the most effective ways to improve such skills are yet to be identified. Examination of training programs of development of soft skills in Higher Education institutions demonstrates that such skills are very diverse. Therefore, in order to establish a framework of soft skills and a way to improve them, this study aims to verify if the practice of riding in educational establishments is a useful educational tool for developing soft skills. To achieve the objectives of the study, the research uses a quantitative method through the application of a questionnaire with 23 soft skills (Rouco, 2012). A sample of 180 individuals (90 riding students and 90 non-riders) from three Portuguese Institutions (Military Academy, Évora University and Military College) was used in the research. The analysis concludes that there are differences in average values of the level of proficiency of soft skills between riding students and non-riders in the Military Academy, Évora University and Military College. Riding students show a higher level of proficiency in soft skills under study, demonstrated in the following: participative leadership, leadership by delegation, consideration, self-control and promoting development. The study concludes that the riding students develop soft skills proficiency levels significantly different from non-riders in all skills under study, except the self-confidence and decision-making.},

abstract={Higher education has been facing great challenges in order to build and / or optimize learning environments that enable students to better suit labor market expectations. The relationship between scientific and technical knowledge and soft skills has a determinant role in a professional performance of excellence. To attend these requirements, the School of Economics and Management at Catholic University of Portugal has developed an approach distinguished by the OECD in 2010 as a best practice of curriculum innovation and skills' development. The Strategic Leadership Hub develops intervention at three levels: 1. coaching and mentoring with students, 2. cooperation with teachers, and 3. approach to the labor market. This article presents some results regarding students' attendance and satisfaction with the intervention processes, soft skills' development and employability rates.},

abstract={Recognition of the importance of soft skills in today's workforce has gained increasing momentum, with educators and industry bodies identifying that generic skills are vitally important to business success. Despite this acknowledgement, a survey of the current literature highlights that many higher education institutions (HEIs) maintain a stronger emphasis on subject-specific knowledge and skill development when compared to soft skills. A number of factors have been shown to influence the development of soft skills including demographic makers, professional body/accreditation requirements and educator personal expectations or views. In this study, the focus is on those educator perceptions which influence the teaching and learning of soft skills. The study is set in Malaysia, where the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) has formally acknowledged the importance of seven soft skills. Semistructured interviews were used to examine the views of 25 educators from five Malaysian Public HEIs. Findings from the interviews showed that educator beliefs and their personal expectations or views influenced their emphasis on the teaching and learning of soft skills. The findings of the study have implications for educators, HEIs and policy makers, and for future research into the effectiveness, roles and responsibilities of HEIs in this important area. © Common Ground, Wan Sofiah Meor Osman, Antonia Girardi, Megan Paull.},

abstract={In today's society and in the future soft skills are becoming more important. The importance of soft skills has been acknowledged in most occupations and many organizations make selection and performance evaluation decisions based in part on employees' soft skills. As such, the requirement for soft skills in all jobs is crucial as they measure the traits that are crucial to the marketability of the graduates. For technically based occupations like engineering, soft skills are also very important for the engineers to apply their technical knowledge at work effectively. The purpose of this paper therefore, is to demonstrate the importance of soft skills to be embedded in the teaching and learning process of hard sciences in Malaysian higher institutions. Information was gathered through a literature review. One of the weak points identified among Malaysian graduates is that they lack the soft skills which are required by the industry, which has lead to the problem of unemployability. This paper discusses the place of soft skills in engineering in the context of higher institutions in Malaysia. It also discusses the initiatives taken by the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysian Council of Engineering Deans, Institution of Engineers Malaysia, and Malaysian universities, particularly the engineering faculties, to produce engineering graduates with high proficiency both in technical and non-technical (soft skills) areas, in realizing the importance of producing engineers who are employable and marketable. The paper concludes with highlighting some of the challenges faced by the higher institutions in implementing soft skills. © Common Ground, Hairuzila Idrus, Hazadiah Mohd Dahan, Normah Abdullah, All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Three UK studies on the relationship between a purpose-built instrument to assess the importance and development of 15 'soft skills' are reported. Study 1 (N = 444) identified strong latent components underlying these soft skills, such that differences between-skills were over-shadowed by differences between-students. Importance and improving ratings on these skills predicted academic performance and accounted for the effects of personality on academic performance. Study 2 replicated the structure of the soft skills inventory and associations with academic performance in a larger sample (N = 1309). Examination of mean differences across faculties (humanities, life sciences, hard sciences) revealed higher soft skills ratings in 'softer' courses. Study 3 (N = 87) incorporated an IQ measure, which was found to be negatively related to importance ratings on soft skills. Results highlight the cohesive structure of beliefs concerning various non-academic skills and their significant links to educationally relevant individual differences. Theoretical, methodological and applied implications are considered. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

Without a quality human capital, a nation will be weak due to want of human factor that is capable of embarking on new initiatives and perspectives.
